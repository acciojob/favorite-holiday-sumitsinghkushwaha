	<h1>Lucknow</h1>
	<p> Lucknow, the capital city of the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, 
		is a place steeped in history, culture, and tradition. Nestled along the 
		banks of the Gomti River, Lucknow has earned its reputation as the "City of Nawabs" 
		due to its association with the Nawabs of Awadh, who were known for their extravagant 
		lifestyle and patronage of arts and culture.</p>
